# CS4481
Course work for image compression, written in C.

## Assignment 1
Generates images as described in the instructions. Allows the user to create a predetermined PBM, PGM, or PPM image and specify the image's width, height, and name.

## Assignment 2
Huffman encoder and decoder for PGM images (unfinished).

## Assignment 3
LZ77 encoder and decoder for PGM images.

## Assignment 4
DPCM encoder and decoder for PGM images. Allows users to choose from the following prediction rules:
- 1: Use W to predict encoded pixels
- 2: Use N to predict encoded pixels
- 3: Use W/2 + N/2 to predict encoded pixels
- 4: Use CALIC initial prediction using binary mode and continuous-tone mode
